# Suspicious-Email-Detection

Course: Computer Networks (IT-3009)

Project Topic: Suspicious Email Detection

Introduction:
In today's interconnected world, email remains one of the primary communication channels.
However, the rise of cyber threats, including phishing and malware distribution through emails,
has necessitated the development of robust techniques for detecting suspicious emails. This
project aims to explore the intricacies of email-based cyber threats and equip students with the
skills to design and implement a Suspicious Email Detection system using concepts from
computer networks.

Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Understanding Email Threats: Develop a comprehensive understanding of different types of
email threats, such as phishing, malware, and spam, and their potential impacts.

Dataset Acquisition: Identify and collect a suitable dataset containing both legitimate and
suspicious emails for training and evaluation.

Preprocessing and Feature Extraction: Preprocess the email data by handling text, attachments,
and headers. Extract relevant features for the detection process.

Algorithm Selection: Investigate various machine learning and natural language processing
algorithms for email classification and anomaly detection.

Model Design: Design a Suspicious Email Detection system that incorporates the selected
algorithms. Determine the architecture, feature selection, and potential ensemble methods.

Evaluation Metrics: Define appropriate metrics for evaluating the performance of the detection
system, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Implementation: Implement the designed system using a programming language such as
Python, making use of libraries and frameworks for machine learning and text analysis.

Validation and Testing: Validate the system's effectiveness through cross-validation techniques
and parameter tuning.
